Que-1 What is Encapsulation in Java? Why is it called Data hiding?
Ans-1 Encapsulation in Java refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit. In encapsulation, a class's variables are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed by the methods of the class in which they are found.

Que-2 What are the important features of Encapsulation?
Ans-2 The following are the significant benefits of encapsulation. A class can have complete control over its data members and data methods. The class will maintain its data members and methods as read-only. Data hiding prevents the user from the complex implementations in the code.

Que-3 What are getter and setter methods in Java Explain with an example
Ans-3 class GetSet {
 
    // Member variable of this class
    private String name;
 
    // Method 1 - Getter
    public String getName() { return name; }
    // Getter is used to get the value.
    // Method 2 - Setter
    public void setName(String N)
    {
 
        // This keyword refers to current instance itself
        this.name = N;
    }
    //Setter is used to set the values.
}
 
// Class 2
// Main class
class GFG {
 
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Creating an object of class 1 in main() method
        GetSet obj = new GetSet();
 
        // Setting the name by calling setter method
        obj.setName("Anirudh");
        // Getting the name by calling getter method
        System.out.println(obj.getName());
    }
}

Que-4 What is the use of this keyword explain with an example
Ans-4 class student{
	private int age;
	private int thisAge;
	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}
	public void setAge(int age) {
		age = age;
	}
	public int getThisAge() {
		return thisAge;
	}
	public void setThisAge(int thisAge) {
		this.thisAge = thisAge;
	}
}
public class Program {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		student obj=new student();
		obj.setAge(5);
		System.out.println(obj.getAge());
		obj.setThisAge(18);
		System.out.println(obj.getThisAge());
	}
}	
output:0
       18

Que-5 What is the advantage of Encapsulation?
Ans-5 Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object. Encapsulation can be used to hide both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.

Que-6 How to achieve encapsulation in Java? Give an example.
Ans-6 class student{
	private int age;
	public int getAge() {
		return age;
	}
	public void setAge(int age) {
		this.age = age;
	}
}
public class Program {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		student obj=new student();
		obj.setAge(5);
		System.out.println(obj.getAge());
	}
}	
output: 5
