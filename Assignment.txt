Que-7 Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples ?
Ans-7 The increment (++) operator (also known as increment unary operator) in Java is used to increase the value of a variable by 1. 
It is two types:
Pre Increment - ++identifier
Post Increment - identifier++

The decrement (--) operator (also known as decrement unary operator) in Java is used to decrease the value of a variable by 1. 
It is two types:
Pre Decrement - --identifier
Post Decrement - identifier--
